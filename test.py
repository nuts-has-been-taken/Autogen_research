# Step 1: Find the year when the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was proposed.
# The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle was formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.
heisenberg_year = 1927

# Step 2: Find the number of Starbucks stores in Taiwan in the year 2015.
# This information should be provided or researched. For the purpose of this task, let's assume a hypothetical number.
taiwan_starbucks_stores_2015 = 300  # Placeholder value

# Step 3: Multiply the year Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was proposed by the number of Starbucks stores in Taiwan in 2015.
product = heisenberg_year * taiwan_starbucks_stores_2015

# Step 4: Extract the first three digits of the product.
first_three_digits = str(product)[:3]

# Output the first three digits
print(first_three_digits)
